# Data-analysis-of-Stack-Overflow-Developers-Survey-2022-

We are going to explore the Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2022 which was conducted in May-2022 with over 70,000 responses from over 180 countries all around the world, to understand and get some insight of all the software developers experience from learning to code to their favorite technologies and the workplace experience of professional developers.

The non-trivial data analysis tasks that we plan to design and implement on Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2022 dataset are: -

1. To analyze what is the impact of company size (i.e., MNCâ€™s or Startups or medium scaled IT business) on the job satisfaction of developers/employees?
2. To analyze whether is there a correlation between the age of developers and the programming languages they are proficient in or interested in learning?
3. To analyze Are the methods of learning software development different across various countries?
